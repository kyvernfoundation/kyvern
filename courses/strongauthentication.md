# Strong authentication
Strong authentication is mandatory. But what is it and what should you choose?
## Strong authentication differs from multifactor authentication
Strong authentication is based on cryptographic mechanisms deemed to be strong, but not necessarily on several authentication factors.
- For example, to connect to your email address and have strong authentication you need to :
  - Your password that only you know
  - A security key that you own
  - Activate your biometric security key by touching it
> Strong authentication means combining these three points: a secret you know, something you possess, something you are or do.
